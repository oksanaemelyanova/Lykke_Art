                <p id="paragDoll">Wrapped in warmth and attitude, Lina struts between
                   sweetness and edge. Her knitted golfs hug her legs 
                   like a love letter to winter, while golden UGGs shimmer 
                   with unexpected charm. Netted tights and a short dress 
                   bring just the right touch of rebel — she's the girl 
                   who owns the room without saying a word.</p>

                <h4 class="doll-slogan">Wander soft, dream loud</h4>
                <p id="paragDoll">Tova is the girl who turns sidewalks into stories. 
                    Her wide beige top billows with ease, paired with 
                    a flirty short skirt and comfy knitted golfs for 
                    that perfect blend of cozy and carefree. 
                    With golden UGGs on her feet and her trusty 
                    Eastpak backpack slung over one shoulder, she's 
                    always ready for her next adventure. A tiny fish 
                    toy dangles playfully — a quiet reminder she never 
                    outgrew her daydreams. High ponytail? Always. 
                    She’s grounded, stylish, and secretly magical.</p>

                <h4 class="doll-slogan">Soft armor, steady soul</h4>
                <p id="paragDoll">Raisa doesn’t rush. She stands.
                    Wrapped in earth-toned layers — a wool skirt, 
                    cozy sweater, and chunky boots with hand-knit 
                    socks climbing high — she holds warmth like a shield. 
                    Her pompom hat adds a gentle flair, but don’t be fooled: 
                    behind that softness is a girl who knows exactly 
                    where she stands and why. She’s not loud, but the ground 
                    listens when she walks.</p>
